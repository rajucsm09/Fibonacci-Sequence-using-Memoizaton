# Fibonacci-Sequence-using-Memoizaton
In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing.



So, how do we implement it while calculating a fibonacci sequence ...
It may not be useful when you calculate first 10th or 15th or 20th fibonacci, but what if you have to deal with 100th or 1000th or even more - Its extreamly helful in these cases ...

Here, its my implementation ...
